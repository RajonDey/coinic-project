# Coinic - Web 3.0 Blockchain Project

## Intro
Web 3.0 paves the way for a future in which different people and machines can interact with data, value, and other counterparties without the involvement of third parties. 
It's so trendy and exciting that, I can't control myself to give it a try. So I was searching for such projects and again got stuck to this man, the JSM Adrian, who is the one and only master of JS projects over the internet.
Anyway, it's so much fun doing this, though pretty complex but at the same time so much compelling. It feels so satisfied after deploying this one.  

Using the following technolgies to build this amazing project:
- React
- Tailwind
- Alchemy
- Hardhat
- Ghiphy
